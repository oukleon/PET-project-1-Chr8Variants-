## Background
- Variant identifier files (VCF) have all the SNP sites from 1000Genome with samples.
- Samples have IDs that connect to the (super)population information.

## Methods
- Download Chromosome8 VCF file.
- The VCF file has rows with SNPs and Columns with positions, Ids, reference/altered sequences and samples, each row has information about the variant
